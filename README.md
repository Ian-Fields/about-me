# About Me
My name is Ian Fields. I am an aspiring web developer with several years of experience in sales and marketing. I have been trusted with growing business in a short amount of time, ensured projects and tasks were completed on time and on budget, as well as being tasked to come into new situations and immediately provide value in that environment with thinking on my feet.

I am engaged to the love of my life and I am pursuing a career as a Full Stack Developer to be able to look back at my life and know that I didn't let the fear of being inadequate control my life.
